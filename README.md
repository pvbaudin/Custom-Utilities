# Nifty terminal tools using [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)

Will update this repo as I make more tools

change conda environment use:
	source change-conda-env.sh

Have to use source otherwise it launches in a sub-shell where conda is not configured 

add alias to .zshrc
alias ce="source /Users/pierre/Useful-Scripts/change-conda-env.sh"

select and kill running process
alias kill-task="/path/to/search-and-kill-task.sh"

the s3-file-manager script might grow into a larger project, navigating s3 object stores this way is pretty pleasant
